# Type Classes

## Problem: Add behaviours to our data types without changing the types

* Issues with inheritance:
  * Types might be in a compiled library
  * Might not want to relate types through a shared hierarchy

## Ad-hoc polymorphism

* We can use type classes to separate:
  * The specification of a behaviour
  * A type from our domain
  * The implementation of that behaviour for our type

## Example
  * Show type class by hand
  * Syntactic sugar through extension methods
  * Instances and scoping
