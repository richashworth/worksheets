# Higher-Kinded Types

* With Monoid and Show type classes, we defined instances for concrete types
    * e.g. `Monoid<Payment>`, `Show<Developer>`

* A number of functional design patterns describe behaviours for more abstract types. 
* In code, we implement these patterns through HKTs

* Example: in `List<String>`, `List` is a type constructor that takes one argument

We can define patterns on 'container' types like List, rather than concrete types like `String`

* No native support in Kotlin, but it's possible.
  * And libraries like Arrow hide the boilerplate
