# Modelling a Business Domain

* ADTs
  * Keep data and functionality separate
  * Use sum-types to model is-a relationships
  * Use product-types to model has-a relationships
  * Can combine these types for more complex entities
  * Can model recursive data types

* Example
    * `Kotlin` is-a `Language`
    * `Person` has-an `Address`
    * Employees in a dev team

* Managing Immutable State

* Example
    * To update state, we _always_ return a new object
    * Changing a developer's postcode
