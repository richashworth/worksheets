# Monoids

## Problem: Merge values of a particular type in different ways

* For some T with `empty` value, we want to be able to write combine(x:T, y:T): T

Such that:

* combine(x, combine(y,z)) == combine(combine (x, y), z)
* combine(x, empty) = x
* combine(empty, x) = x

* Type classes allow us to extract the mechanics of combining values from our business logic

* Can define multiple monoid instances for the same type to describe different
  ways of combining values
